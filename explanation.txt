Coed is a programming language that resembles english in many ways.

It is interpertation based, but before running the interperator script,
you need to make sure these things are true.

1. The interperator script MUST be in the same directory.
2. Coed files can NOT import other files or libraries.
3. Coed files can NOT have spaces in their names, 
	or else the interperator will not run properly
4. The script MUST start with 'create~whatever: as* function' or it wont work.
	Tabs are optional.
